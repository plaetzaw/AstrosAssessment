# Houston Astros Assessment

This is a code assessment for the Houston Astros Front End Developer position

## Challenges

This was my first time really using a graph and dynamic data. While I was able to intergrate the data into the chart, it wasn't scaling properly and the bars don't line up with the values properly. But all the values are present.

This was definitely the hardest code assessment I've ever done. I've been mostly focused on responsive web design and learning to use flexbox and grid effectively. I haven't been able to spend much time working on array and data manipluation, which to me seemed to be the primary part of this challenge.

If I had more time I would have gone back and fixed the chart issue. I don't know how long the fix would take via reading the documentation for the chart package I was using. But that's where I'd start.

Next, I'd go back and add some conditional styling for the pitch display. I used almost no CSS in this challenge because I spent most of the time focused on functionality.
